Code for my MS degree and adjoining paper at the University of Wyoming

## Introduction
This project provides the final code that made it into my thesis document submitted to the University of Wyoming. It also contains my version of the final code that was used in the manuscript submitted to Ecology and Evolution on 12/27/2019. However, this code was re-done in Jump by C. Benkman, so is not entirely up to date.
